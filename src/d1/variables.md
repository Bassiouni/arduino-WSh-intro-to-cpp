# Variables && Data Types

## So what is a variable?

Simply you can imagin it as a box in which we store stuff.

You may ask what is this _" stuff "_ acctually means.

It is called _data_, when we write a program in C++ we want to be able to use data; most of what programming is about is actually using data, we manipulate data, _that's what we do_.

In other words variables allow us to name a piece of data we store in memory so we can use it.

What matters is not what the types do to our variables but the size is the important thing about them.

Let's discuss it more in the next page!
