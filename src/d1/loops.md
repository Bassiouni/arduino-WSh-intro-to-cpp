# Loops

In C++ we have 4 types of loops:

- `for` loop
- `while` loop
- `do ... while` loop
- `goto` __!!!__ we are not going to explain it as it makes what is called a _"[spaghetti code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code#:~:text=Spaghetti%20code%20is%20a%20pejorative,with%20insufficient%20ability%20or%20experience.)"_

`recursion` can be considered as a loop
