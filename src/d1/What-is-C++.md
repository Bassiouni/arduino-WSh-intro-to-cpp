# What is C++

C++ is a Strongly Typed [geberal-purpose programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_programming_language) created by [Bjarne Stroustrup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bjarne_Stroustrup) at [Bell Labs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT%26T_Bell_Labs) in 1980.

At first it was built as a pre-processor for the [C programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) with the name of "C with [classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(programming))" as one of its inspirations was the [Simula programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simula).
